# The Tengri Performance Thesis

This document serves as a technical bridge between the linguistic philosophy outlined in the book ["Tartarus & I"](./Tartarus_&_I.html) and the engineering goals of the Tengri Language Project. It explains the core hypothesis for a technical audience, free from historical or philosophical context.

## 1. The Problem: Inherent Inefficiencies in Modern Computing

For decades, the primary gains in application speed came from hardware improvements (Moore's Law). As single-core performance has plateaued, the burden of performance has shifted back to software. However, modern high-level languages carry significant architectural overhead:

* **Syntactic Complexity:** Languages like C++, Rust, and Scala have complex grammars that require computationally expensive parsing and semantic analysis. This slows down compilation and tooling.
* **Abstraction Penalty:** High-level abstractions, while beneficial for productivity, often come at a performance cost. Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs), complex serialization protocols (like JSON over HTTP), and dynamic dispatch mechanisms add layers of indirection that consume CPU cycles.
* **Interpreter Overhead:** Dynamically typed languages like Python and JavaScript pay a constant performance tax at runtime due to type checking, attribute lookups, and the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython.

## 2. The Hypothesis: Linguistic Clarity as Computational Clarity

The core hypothesis of the Tengri project is that the structural and semantic clarity of **agglutinative languages** (such as Kazakh) can serve as a blueprint for a more efficient computing paradigm.

This is not a mystical concept, but an engineering one. Agglutinative morphology works like a simple, linear state machine:

`ROOT + SUFFIX_1 + SUFFIX_2 + ... + SUFFIX_N`

Each morpheme (a meaningful unit) has a single, unchanging function. When applied to language design, this suggests:

* **Faster Parsing:** A language with a simple, linear, and non-ambiguous grammar can be parsed significantly faster than one with a complex, context-sensitive grammar.
* **Reduced Abstraction Cost:** By creating a direct mapping between linguistic archetypes (the core concepts of the language) and machine operations, we can build a system with fewer layers of abstraction, leading to more direct and faster execution paths.
* **Optimized Execution:** A clear and simple syntax allows the compiler to make more aggressive and reliable assumptions, enabling better optimization at every stage of execution.

The Kazakh language is not the source of the *magic*; it is the source of the *model*. It is a well-preserved example of a natural system that evolved for clarity and efficiency, which we use as inspiration for our technical architecture.

## 3. Our Approach: The 4-Stage Performance Roadmap

To test this hypothesis, we are building the Tengri language ecosystem in four distinct, measurable stages:

1.  **AST Interpreter (Current):** A tree-walking interpreter written in Go. The goal of this stage is to validate the language semantics, build a working parser, and provide a functional REPL. Performance is expected to be low but should already outperform other interpreters like CPython in certain tasks due to the efficiency of the Go runtime.
2.  **Bytecode VM (In Progress):** A register-based virtual machine. This stage translates the AST into a compact, linear bytecode format. This eliminates the overhead of walking the AST, leading to a significant performance jump (estimated 10-50x over the AST interpreter).
3.  **JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler:** A tiered JIT compiler will be built on top of the VM. It will identify and compile "hot" code paths into native machine code at runtime, dramatically reducing the gap with fully compiled languages.
4.  **AOT (Ahead-of-Time) Compiler:** The final stage is a full AOT compiler, likely leveraging an existing backend like LLVM. This will produce highly optimized, standalone executables with performance competitive with languages like Go and Rust.

## 4. Early Results: A Validation of the Thesis

Our initial benchmarks already provide strong evidence supporting our hypothesis. By comparing our AST interpreter and prototype VM against native Go and Python, we have observed:

* Our **AST interpreter**, despite its inherent slowness, is already **significantly faster than Python** in recursion-heavy tasks.
* Our prototype **Bytecode VM** demonstrates performance that is **orders of magnitude faster than Python** and **nearly on par with native Go** for iterative, compute-bound tasks.

These results validate that our architectural choices are sound and that the performance goals are achievable. For detailed, reproducible results, please see the [**Benchmarks section in our main README**](../../README.md#live-benchmarks).
