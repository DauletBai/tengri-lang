# Tengri Language

Tengri is an experimental programming language designed to explore novel concepts in compilation, runtime efficiency, and language design. Our core hypothesis is that the structural clarity of agglutinative languages can serve as a model for a more performant and intuitive computing paradigm.

The project follows a clear performance path: **AST Interpreter â†’ Bytecode VM â†’ JIT Compiler â†’ AOT Compiler**.

---

## ðŸš€ Performance Highlights

Our benchmarks demonstrate that Tengri's AOT compiler generates highly optimized native code, **achieving performance parity with established languages like C, Rust, and Go.**

-   **Recursion-Heavy Tasks:** In recursive Fibonacci tests (`fib_rec` for N=34), Tengri-AOT is on par with C and Rust, and slightly faster than Go.
-   **Iteration-Heavy Tasks:** For iterative tasks (`fib_iter`), Tengri-AOT is in the same top tier as C, Rust, and Go, with execution times often too fast to be accurately measured in our micro-benchmark.

These results validate our core hypothesis. For detailed, reproducible results, see our [**Performance & Benchmarks Guide**](README.performance.md) and the raw CSV files in [`benchmarks/latest/results/`](benchmarks/latest/results/).

## Latest Results (MacBook Air M2)

The following results were obtained from a full run of our benchmark suite. Times are the average per-call duration. Lower is better.

### Recursive Fibonacci (`fib_rec`, N=34)

This test measures the efficiency of function calls and recursion, a critical factor for overall performance.

| Target     | Time (seconds) | Relative to C |
| :--------- | :------------- | :------------ |
| **Tengri AOT** | **0.0268** | **0.99x** |
| C (baseline) | 0.0269         | 1.00x         |
| Rust       | 0.0278         | 1.03x         |
| Go         | 0.0311         | 1.15x         |

**Conclusion**: Tengri-AOT achieves **performance parity with native C and Rust code**, validating the effectiveness of the transpilation strategy.

### Iterative Fibonacci (`fib_iter`)

This test measures the efficiency of tight loops and basic arithmetic. The execution is so fast that results are near the measurement noise floor.

| Target     | Performance Tier |
| :--------- | :--------------- |
| **Tengri AOT** | **Tier 1 (Native Speed)** |
| C          | Tier 1 (Native Speed) |
| Rust       | Tier 1 (Native Speed) |
| Go         | Tier 1 (Native Speed) |
| VM         | Tier 2 (Very Fast Interpreter) |

**Conclusion**: For iterative code, Tengri-AOT is in the same top performance tier as other compiled languages. The VM provides excellent performance for a non-native backend.
