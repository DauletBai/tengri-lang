**Tengri** is an experimental programming language designed to explore a core hypothesis: that the structural clarity and efficiency of agglutinative languages can be a model for a more performant and intuitive computing paradigm.

Inspired by the morphology of the Kazakh language, Tengri aims to translate linguistic simplicity into computational speed. The project follows a clear, multi-stage performance roadmap:
`AST Interpreter ‚Üí Bytecode VM ‚Üí JIT Compiler ‚Üí AOT Compiler`

## üöÄ Performance: On Par with C

Our comprehensive benchmarks validate the core hypothesis. Tengri's Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiler generates highly optimized C code that achieves **performance parity with native C and Rust in compute-bound tasks.**

The latest results were captured on a MacBook Air (ARM64). For a detailed analysis, see our [**Performance & Benchmarks Guide**](README.performance.md).

#### Recursive Benchmark (`fib_rec`, N=35)
This test highlights the efficiency of function call overhead. **Tengri is the champion here.**

| Implementation | Time (avg)    | Relative to C |
| :---           | :---          | :---          |
| Tengri         | 44,420,600 ns | 0.99x    üèÜ   |
| C (baseline)   | 44,591,000 ns | 1.00x         |
| Rust           | 45,446,050 ns | 1.02x         |
| Go             | 50,745,867 ns | 1.14x         |

#### Sort Benchmark (`qsort`, N=100,000)
This test measures performance on memory-intensive operations.

| Implementation | Time (avg) | Relative to C |
| :---           | :---       | :---          |
| Go (optimized) | 133,600 ns | 0.23x         |
| C (qsort)      | 577,200 ns | 1.00x         |
| Tengri  (qsort)| 653,200 ns | 1.13x.        |

**Conclusion:** The results are a massive success. They prove that for raw computation and function calls, Tengri's AOT-compiled code is just as fast‚Äîor even faster‚Äîthan native C.
